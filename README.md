## What this is

This repository is my personal **detection journal**: every day I take one high-impact, technically meaty case from the threat intel feed (vendor write-ups from Mandiant, Microsoft, Volexity, Unit 42, ESET, Talos, Securelist, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Dragos, etc., plus DFIR Report and CISA advisories) and translate it into **deployable detection content**:

- **Sigma** rules (vendor-agnostic, convertible via `pySigma`/`uncoder`/`sigmac`)
- **KQL** queries (Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR)
- **YARA** rules (file/process memory)
- **Suricata / Snort** signatures — when relevant
- **PEAK / TaHiTI hunting hypotheses** with baselines

Each entry is grounded on a published, sourced case so it stays defensible and reproducible.

---

## What this is **not**

- Not a feed for production blocklists. Validate every IOC before wiring it into preventive controls — confidence levels are documented, but circumstances change.
- Not a SigmaHQ replacement. Upstream-quality rules go to [SigmaHQ](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) via PR; this is the **lab notebook** that precedes that step.
- Not weaponized PoCs. All offensive snippets here are publicly documented and live for **detection design**, not exploitation.

## Naming convention

```
days/YYYY-MM-DD_<short-slug>/
```

- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date the **class was delivered**, not the date the case was disclosed.
- `<short-slug>` is the campaign ID, malware family, or actor (kebab-case). Examples:
  - `2026-05-04_C0063-Poland-Wiper`
  - `2026-05-03_BAUXITE-CyberAvengers-AA26-097A`
  - `2026-05-02_Nexcorium-TBK-DVR-CVE-2024-3721`

Rule files inside follow:

```
<technique-or-payload>.<ext>
```

---

## Rule metadata standard

Every Sigma rule must include:

```yaml
title:        # imperative, < 80 chars
id:           # UUID v4
status:       # experimental | test | stable | deprecated
description:  # 2–4 lines, plain English, what + why
references:
  - https://...    # primary vendor write-up
  - https://...    # secondary corroboration
  - https://attack.mitre.org/...
author:       # your handle
date:         # YYYY/MM/DD
modified:     # YYYY/MM/DD
tags:
  - attack.<tactic>
  - attack.<technique-id>
  - cve.YYYY-NNNN   # if applicable
logsource:    # exact provider/service/category
detection:
  ...
falsepositives:
  - ...        # always at least one — be honest
level:        # informational | low | medium | high | critical
```

Every KQL file starts with a header comment block:

```kql
// Title:        Lateral Movement via Rubeus S4U2self with TGS Burst
// Id:           uuid-v4
// MITRE:        T1558.003, T1550.003
// Reference:    https://...
// Author:       <handle>
// Date:         2026-05-04
// Tested on:    Sentinel (DeviceProcessEvents, SecurityEvent)
// FP notes:     Legitimate constrained delegation cases; baseline before deploy.
```

Every YARA rule keeps the `meta:` block populated with `author`, `description`, `date`, `reference`, `confidence`, and (where relevant) `eset_family` / `vendor_family`.

---

## How to use

### Microsoft Sentinel / Defender XDR

```kql
// Drop the .kql contents into:
// Sentinel → Analytics → Create → Scheduled query rule
// or Defender XDR → Hunting → Custom detection rule
```

### Sigma → vendor target

```bash
pip install pysigma pysigma-backend-microsoft365defender
sigma convert -t microsoft365defender days/2026-05-04_C0063-Poland-Wiper/sigma/*.yml
```

### YARA — scan a triage image

```bash
yara -r days/2026-05-04_C0063-Poland-Wiper/yara/*.yar /mnt/triage/
```

---

## Validation

Validation runs **locally before each commit** — no CI involved. Three entry points
depending on what you want to check:

```bash
# 1) Quick offline check — no external tools, just PyYAML
python3 tools/validate_all.py

# 2) Full chain — runs offline check + every external tool you have installed
./tools/lint_all.sh

# 3) Sigma-only quick path (fast)
./tools/lint_sigma.sh
```

What gets validated:

| Format | Offline (`validate_all.py`) | External tool (`lint_all.sh`) |
|---|---|---|
| Sigma `.yml` | UUID, status, level, modifiers, condition refs | `sigma check` |
| YARA `.yar` | rule blocks, brace balance, `condition:` section, dup names | `yara -w rule.yar /dev/null` |
| Suricata `.rules` | action, sid uniqueness, `(...;)` body, msg/rev | `suricata -T -S rule.rules` |
| KQL `.kql` | bracket balance, header comments, keyword presence, trailing-pipe | — |
| CSV `iocs.csv` | header schema, row width | — |
| YAML | strict load (workflows + Sigma + every `.yml`) | — |
| Markdown | broken relative links | `markdownlint` |
| Bash `.sh` | `bash -n` if available | `shellcheck` |
| GitHub Actions | YAML load | `actionlint` |

Recommended install for the full local chain:

```bash
pip install --user pysigma sigma-cli \
            pysigma-backend-microsoft365defender pysigma-pipeline-sysmon yamllint
sudo apt-get install -y yara suricata shellcheck
bash <(curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
sudo install -m 0755 actionlint /usr/local/bin/actionlint
npm install -g markdownlint-cli
```

## Test before you ship

Every rule should be exercised — at minimum mentally — against [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) tests for the same technique IDs.

When in doubt, follow the [PEAK Threat Hunting Framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html):

1. **Prepare** — what hypothesis am I testing?
2. **Execute** — run the hunt, baseline, refine.
3. **Act on Knowledge** — promote to detection, document false-positive surface, harden.

---

## Index

See [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) for the chronological + thematic index of all cases.

---

## Source policy

- **Triangulate.** Every case must reference at least two independent sources (vendor write-up + agency advisory, or two vendors with overlap).
- **Cite primary.** Always link to the original write-up, not aggregator headlines.
- **Mark confidence.** When attribution is contested (e.g., Static Tundra vs. Sandworm for C0063), document both views and the evidence each anchors on.
- **Never invent IOCs, hashes, or CVEs.** If a hash isn't published, the rule is heuristic and labelled as such.
